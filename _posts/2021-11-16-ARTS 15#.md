## Algorithm

本周的算法题是  [Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

### **Rule**

Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```java
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

 

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
```

**Example 4:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph-1.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[2],[1]]
Output: [[2],[1]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `Node.val` is unique for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

### **Solution**

```java
public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node==null) {
            return null;
        }
        // 已经遍历过node集合，key：原来的node，value:clone的node
        Map<Node, Node> visited = new HashMap<>();
        Node newNode = new Node(node.val);
        visited.put(node,newNode);
        // 保证node的遍历顺序
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(node);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Node cur = queue.poll();
            for (Node item : cur.neighbors) {
                if (!visited.containsKey(item)) {
                    visited.put(item,new Node(item.val));
                    queue.offer(item);
                }
                visited.get(cur).neighbors.add(visited.get(item));
            }
        }
        return visited.get(node);
    }
```

## Review

[Things unlearned](https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/things-unlearned/) 文章亮明了一个观点：学习一门新的语言是很酷，但我认为程序员做大量的编码练习，尤其有些挑战的练习更有帮助。
